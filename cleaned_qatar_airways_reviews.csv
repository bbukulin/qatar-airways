2024-02-29,1.0,10.0,Wayne Burgess,Australia,"""no attempt to address our complaint""","  I have sent 5 emails and have only received 2 automatic response emails after initiating our complaint 10 weeks ago. I have sent all of the relevant documentation to support our claim for a refund. Our group of 3 booked adjoining Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck of an A380 from Doha to Perth after a connecting flight from Amman. We paid for our Exit Row seats on August 22 2023 and received email confirmation that day. What was a shock to us is that when we were at Amman airport we got our tickets for the second leg, from Doha to Perth, we saw that we had been seats on the lower deck. We said this was wrong and showed our August confirmation for seats 30 A, B and C on the upper deck. We were told by Qatar Airways staff in Amman that it could only be fixed up in Doha. We were also told that the reason was that the plane had been changed from an A380 (which was not correct) . Our connecting flight from Amman to Doha was not only cancelled but deleted altogether meaning we had a 10.5 hour transit instead of the original 2.5 hours. Then at the Boarding Gate in Amman we were informed that there were 2 Exit Row seats available in the Upper Deck and that these had been put on hold for us and to see the Qatar Ground staff in Doha. We were in a queue for almost an hour at the Qatar Service Desk in Doha. I asked how the seats we had booked and paid extra for in August, and provided emails and a hard copy to verify this, were no longer available for us? We were told that it was a system error. There was no apology at all for the system error. We were further disappointed to find out that the 2 Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck that we had been told by staff at the boarding Gate at Amman had been “reserved” were not actually retained for us and that only 1 Exit Row seat was available. Understandably we were not happy that we did not receive the Exit Row seats that we had booked and paid for more than 3 months prior. Through no fault of our own we were victims of a Qatar Airways system error. We did not complain to the flight attendants on the Doha to Perth flight as we understood that they had no control over the seat allocation. However, we politely asked the people in seats 30A and 30B, that we had paid for in August, when they had purchased their seats and were informed that they had done so about 2 weeks prior. I chose Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck because of the extra space and the cabin configuration of 2 by 4 by 2 seats and because my wife and I would be seated next to each other and the other member of our group would be in the next available Exit Row seat. Instead of all being seated next to each other in Exit Row seats we were split up and certainly didn’t get what we paid for. Plus all of the wasted time trying unsuccessfully in Amman and then at the Transit Desk in Doha to sort out the error created by Qatar Airways assigning our seats to someone else. It is bad enough that we didn’t get 2 of the Exit Row seats that we had paid for that were allocated to other people who booked well after us. What is worse is that there has been no attempt by Qatar Airways to address our complaint let alone issue the refund to which we are entitled. Our complaint isn’t complex.",Business,Economy Class,November 2023,A380,Doha to Perth,Doha,Direct,Perth,1.0,no

During  booking one has to pay for seats in case one does not want to wait until check-in. On the first leg the crew mechanically did their job. It is ok, but not what you expect from Qatar Airways. Amenity kits are not provided any longer on every flight during the night. Nonetheless you sometimes still find the old welcoming and service oriented Qatar Airways spirit. The crew on the second leg was outstanding as well as ground staff at JRO.

2024-01-27,1.0,10.0,Peter Dyson,United Kingdom,“it was not the standard expected”," Firstly I must state that on three of the legs of my journey to Penang and back to Birmingham were excellent. On 23 September boarded flight from Penang to Doha. There is a short hop from Penang to Phuket and the crew were very good, a special note for Melissa who was friendly, engaging and attentive and a credit to Qatar Airways. However everything changed when a new crew embarked at Phuket. They were sullen and unsmiling from the outset. Service was abysmal. Tablecloths were given as serviettes and getting a glass of wine or water was like getting blood from a stone. Distribution of food was chaotic. I am not sure if this was the fault of the Cabin Manager or the individual flight attendants or some disagreement among the crew. Whatever, it was not the standard expected from business class on Qatar. Shortly before landing the Cabin Manager did his rounds and I stated I was unhappy with the service...about 10 minutes later he returned and asked for more information. If Qatar Airways read these comments I hope they investigate this matter and it was a blotch on the otherwise excellent service I was provided by other aircrews.",Business,Business Class,January 2024,Boeing 777,Penang to Doha via Phuket,Penang,Phuket,Doha,1.0,no

Cabin is well-maintained and clean, very spacious for 900/1000 series. The leg space was ample and seat space is great too. The cabin crews are friendly and professional but among them, there is 1 steward who went extra miles to make my journey extra special. He seems like the most junior one but he was very confident and helpful. As I was traveling with a broken foot, he assisted me with my hand carry bags till the point I left the cabin (taken over by ground staff). Every crew did their jobs but he made an extra effort to help a passenger.

2024-01-18,10.0,10.0,David Owen,Australia,"""genuine warmth and hospitality""","  I have flown with Qatar in economy, business and in first class. I fly two or three times a year with them. I recently had the privilege of experiencing the epitome of airborne luxury aboard the world's best airline, and I must say that the exceptional service provided by the cabin crew left an indelible mark on my travel experience. From the moment I stepped on board until the final descent, every aspect of the journey was a testament to the dedication and professionalism of the airline's remarkable cabin crew. Beyond the technical aspects of the service, what truly set this airline's cabin crew apart was their genuine warmth and hospitality. It was evident that they enjoyed their work and took pride in creating a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for passengers. Whether it was a friendly conversation, a reassuring smile, or going the extra mile to accommodate special requests, the cabin crew consistently exceeded expectations. In conclusion, the world's best airline undoubtedly boasts the world's best cabin crew. Their commitment to excellence, attention to detail, and genuine hospitality set a standard that other airlines would do well to emulate. Traveling with this airline is not just a journey; it's an unforgettable experience that leaves passengers feeling pampered, valued, and eager to embark on their next adventure with the finest cabin crew in the skies.",Solo Leisure,First Class,January 2024,A380,London to Perth via Doha,London,Doha,Perth,1.0,Yes

Cabins were clean, comfortable and spacious. Meals were decent - maybe a bit on the small side, but good quality. IFE was also good, plenty of choices there. What really stood out though was the service - staff were almost consistently friendly, polite, attentive and caring. I had a couple of crew who really looked out for me, introducing themselves, offering regular drink top-ups (decent selection of wines were offered) and priority meal selection as a silver FF member.

When I asked the Qatar agent on why we had to arrive 4 hours before departure, she didn’t know why and she opened the counters 3 hours before departure as scheduled.

2024-01-11,8.0,10.0,Theo Anastasakis,Greece,"""extraordinary efficiency and professionality""","  We booked and confirmed our tickets to India 9 months before the date of departure. (ATH-DOH, DOH-CCU). At some point and close to departure date, we received an email from Qatar informing us that our flights were cancelled, and we should either ask for refund or reschedule. Our already booked program and domestic flights did not allow us to cancel and rebook new flights. A very polite Qatar staff assisted us over the phone to reschedule by adding an extra flight and 6-7 hrs additional traveling time to our outgoing flights (ATH-SAW-DOH-CCU) Waiting time in Doha for our connection was 50 min on both legs outgoing and returning. On both trips upon arrival at DOH , there was a lengthy bus ride from the plane to the terminal of almost 15-20 min which was followed by a hurried security check and then a sprint to the gate to catch the next flight, which we boarded last, to realize that our initially booked and prepaid seats  were messed up. The issue was smoothly and quickly resolved by the very polite and mindful cabin manager on QR 203 on Dec 17th. In any case, our mixed feelings from our eventful Qatar booking experience, were all surpassed by the positive impression of the cabin crew's extraordinary efficiency and professionality. All Qatar accolades go to the hard working cabin crew. I also wish to highlight the better passenger experience that the A350 offers compared to the one on B787, which felt very cramped.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,December 2023,A350 / Boeing 787,Athens to Kolkata via Doha,Athens,Doha,Kolkata,1.0,Yes

Departure gate for the next flight very crowded and also chaotic and unorganized. The poor sole agent at the door had to endure a lot of shouting and pushing; the zone system simply does not work at Doha airport.

The day before travelling I received the email from Qatar Airways, informing me of the change of aircraft. I understand that, in certain circumstances, airlines have to change aircrafts for operational reasons from time to time, but when this happens and ends up in a sort of downgrade, it becomes quite annoying. The DOH-BKK flight, originally equipped with Qsuites, was replaced by an old 777 with a 2-2-2 configuration. I had to sleep on a very uncomfortable angled bed. Qatar Airways, in the email sent to me the day before the departure, wanted to emphasize two things:  If I wanted to keep the Qsuites, I could change dates for free; I obviously contacted them immediately and they proposed an alternative to me, but they told me that I would have to pay another 2700 EUR. I don't quite understand the meaning of free in it. Alternatively, despite the lack of Qsuites, I could still take advantage of all the luxury and comfort of Qatar Airways.

2023-10-31,6.0,10.0,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,"""there were no transfer counters"""," Riyadh to Doha 28-10 2023 on a full, late evening flight. Modern aircraft, A350-900Q. On time. Check-in became a hassle, as there were no transfer counters and I had to shift terminal by arriving with Saudia. I was forced to pay for a transit visa, 150 USD, despite I was never on landside and had only 1 hour transit time. This scrupulous exploitation is unacceptable, just taking advantage of people in rush. QR have no transfer desk nor transfer service in a big international airport to where they are flying several times per day. The good thing is that they, upon my request, at least reopened the check-in counter allowing me to check-in even after the minimum time of 60 minutes had elapsed. A lady behind me was also late, but disallowed to check-in, contrary to me. So, at least I got some premium for my hefty visa fee.

To the extend they are about to become intrusive as they have too little to do. Transfer and revised seat selection was easy with new robot machines in the lounges. After the machine reads your passport, you get full overview and can print out new BP yourself. Impressive. Short evening flight, less than 1 hour duration. Huge aircraft, virtually full (300 pax?). Briefly on time. Gate boarding functioned well through division of passengers into 4 zones. I was treated with respect and served excellently. Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel, which had raised my expectations. And, it was all there: served a nice, cold Arabian mezze, nicely prepared and presented in a transparent design box separated in food sections with a spoon fixed elegantly across the sections. Softdrinks numerous, but surprisingly, cava “champagne” was served as well as wine, spirits, and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive. Staff competent, focused, polite, and extremely efficient. They gave me 3 seats due to my Privilege status at their FFP. Headset, blankets given. IFE and WiFi functioned well, was given a headset of good quality. Even if I would have been offered a free business class seat, I would not have changed it for my given 69G seat. I have a full appreciation and pleasant experience from this flight and cant fault anything. FA were well groomed, well rested, and in a transmitting, sparkling mood.

We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one.

When I requested compensation for the previous flights, since I paid a premium for those Qsuite bookings too, I received 2 identical pre-written standard responses saying that they were not willing to compensate, not even with some Qmiles. I am really upset, since the Qsuites are promoted everywhere on the booking app, but what’s the point of booking a Qsuite if I don get it!

There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side.

As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear. When so much else is so good, this is surely a major error on an overnight flight.

The newest of their aircraft was the best to fly on - the A350, with a roomy and airy feeling, with high ceiling. The in-flight experience was mostly good, but they could be more generous with drinks and snacks between meals. Children don't always eat at the designated times during the flight. The worst part of our experience was the structure of the ground service and connections. We had to re-check our bags in Tokyo for the domestic flights, security checks in-transit in Doha, buses for the Dublin flight in Doha, and QR don't issue boarding passes for the JAL domestic connection.

Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a “relish the myriad of exclusive offerings”. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn’t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR’s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process.

Even on relatively short 4 hour flights there were pillows and blankets on each seat. IFE was decent, with a wide selection of movies and programmes to choose from. The food was all of a high standard - a good selection (usually 3 choices) of meals, and each was tasty and filling. I was very impressed with the alcohol selection - a sparkling wine (rare in economy class), quality red and white wine, two beers, and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service: the crew were friendly, attentive, and polite. Drink runs were regular, and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers, the staff were wonderful - constantly checking up on us, offering more drinks, proactively offering to make a festive cocktail (in economy class!), and ensuring our comfortable. All flights were on-time, and Doha airport was a pleasure to transit through.

Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance. Impressive work by QR who, together with the airport in Bangkok, saved the mistake done by Rwandair in Kigali.

I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated.

The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location.

The outbound flight crew were awful and the cabin service was poor, the crew appeared tired and 'hassled' and were not at all friendly. They did not appear to be fully trained as the usual and past cabin crew have always been, the food was really poor and tasteless. We took advantage of an upgrade offer (QR3900) for our return journey to Doha hoping to enjoy a better quality service upon our return. It proved to be anything but. Firstly the Business Class Lounge catering to Qatar Airways Business Class passengers was closed? We went to other lounges but they were full and would not accept us, eventually we found a lounge that did offer us seats in their reception area. The snack food was truly below par, so too was the extremely poor selection of beverages. We boarded on time and the crew were definitely better and friendlier than our outbound flight, the menu appeared OK but when the food was served it was not up to the Airlines usual standard. I had only a mouthful and could not eat the rest, the chicken that was served to my wife was overcooked and extremely tough. So from a clear '10' that we would rate on all of our previous flights with Qatar Airways our rating on this recent experience would be 4/10.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,July 2022,Boeing 787,Athens to Doha,Athens,Direct,Doha,1.0,no

The next best seats are 17C and 17H, those are aisle seats with no seats in front. Qatar' economy food was pretty good and sufficient. The AVML choices are offered in the standard menu so no need to order special meals. The quality of food was surprisingly good in all segments. Not too oily, spicy.

We lodged our concerns to seek alternative arrangements and or suitable recovery efforts at Doha Airport. To-date we have not heard from QR office despite 2 email reminders. Upon landing at Doha Airport, we approached Qatar Airways Transit Desk to listen to what recovery arrangements have been made for affected passengers. We requested for a ‘Flight disruption letter’ to facilitate any possible travel insurance claim. The Manager told us that no flight disruption letter will be issued from Doha as the flight disruption had taken place outbound from Singapore. However, this was inconsistent with what passengers were told when the same request was made at the QR check-in counter in Singapore ie. to be provided at DOHA. In relation to our request for accommodation / lounge access, the Manager explained that due to COVID reasons, no accommodation nor lounge access could be arranged for affected passengers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Qatar Airways, the least one would expect is for the airline to mitigate the inconvenience caused through other measures.

Flight was uneventful, food was nothing to shout about. Champagne was uncoiled, red wine was ice cold. I was glad that my flight from Doha was from B2 gate and not the usual bus station like E area. I could not be more wrong. They used an empty airbridge gate and used buses from there. The worst part was to sit in an very hot aircraft with an open door on the tarmac with a very weak aircondition. Generally, Doha Airport has lost its advantage over other airports and is the weakest part of the overall experience while flying Qatar.

We were offered a £40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve ‘preferred’ seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all.

A very helpful member of staff re-issued our tickets in economy after phoning reservations and after over an hour stood at checkin. No fault of his and he was a credit to the company. On board I felt the staff were efficient but never over-friendly and it was an hour and a half before we were even offered a drink.

2022-03-05,9.0,10.0,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,"""The IFE is world class""","  Flew 1st March 2022 on brand new aircrafts, B787-9 and A350-1000, respectively. Flights on time. Ticket purchase, upgrade by miles (2nd leg), ground services, ticket changes went smooth. I had to change a simple economy ticket 4 times. Only once I was charged additional (minimal charge). Check-in in CPH easy and quick getting all 3 boarding passes at once. This, despite I faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond Singapore to Papua New Guinea. Their cooperation with partner Air Niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief. QR respect their elite members on ground as well as on board – for this trip there were no let-downs or real issues – their call centre was excellent, decisional, and cooperative. Lounge experiences: QR uses now the Eventyr Lounge in CPH which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used. Further, it is situated in non-Schengen area 3 Minutes from boarding gate. The Eventyr lounge is good, likely the best in Copenhagen - but it is still below world class. The best is the views, service, showers, and draught beer presence. Hot food only provides 1 dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse. No champagne and poor wines. They should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge. In Doha, the Al Mourjan Lounge is back to previous (pre-Corona) standards – lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming. Good showers and very good relax/working options. CPH-DOH: I was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so I could spread out with my things. Free WiFi for 1 hour granted, it worked well. Stewardess(es) were of high quality. Food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago. Sparkling wine (cava) offered in economy. The 2 wines were good. The new beers to replace the Heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull, industrial lagers (Budwiser and Stella Artois). Arrived in Doha well pampered and in a splendid mood. DOH-SIN (night-flight) in business: Embarking in Doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride. The Q-suites in business class are in my view completely overrated. These micro-cabins deprive passengers contact, air and view. Window access poor from those seats forward directed. If one sits backwards oriented, the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me. Seats and beds were excellent. The IFE is world class with updated movies, huge selection options, and the best I have ever encountered. Huge soft touch monitors. Smooth travel, reliable airline, flights on time. FAs excellent, 2 kinds: well-trained caretakers and less trained food-bringers. High class dining though without true dinner. The food was good but just “light, cold dinner snacks”. Cold lobster bites dont quite make it. Breakfast better, but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty. Coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class. Drinks were World-class: 2 champagnes and 6 wines offered – all expensive and of high quality. Bollinger 2006 rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best I have had for long. One quality beer, Leffe Blonde, was outstanding.

My experience was at best average, and a disappointment after having such high expectations. I purchased extra legroom in the emergency exit row. When I reached my seat during boarding there was the pillow, blanket, amenity kit, and headphones on my seat. I set them down next to my seat on the floor, as there was no where else where I could have access to them while seated. For take off procedures the flight attendant grabbed all of the items and put them into the overhead storage bin away from my seat. When I was able to get up, I could not even locate all of the items. My food was average at best and staff took so long to collect the used meal trays that passengers were bringing their trays to the staff workstation. My one beef with the entertainment system was that they played the same airline/airport commercial every time you watched a new show. When time my flight arrived in Doha we had to exit using stairs and board a shuttle to reach the terminal. And with all of the other COVID rules on masks and cleaning, why would you pack in passengers on a shuttle bus until it is very full. I sent a fairly comprehensive email to Qatar Airways that highlighted my disappointment, received an automated reply from the airline nearly two weeks ago acknowledging receipt of my email but I have heard nothing back since. Perhaps it is the highly rated business class product that is generating the rave reviews.

Not enough seats, overcrowded, no social distancing. The rude and clearly incompetent gate agent shouted at his staff and contributed to the already stressful atmosphere. Priority boarding is a joke at the bus gates, as priority guests are allowed to enter the plane last. The plane was an oldish A332 with the very old narrow business class seats. Due to the uncomfortable seat, no sleep for me. Service was disappointing. I asked for just a glass of water and no food after takeoff and had to ask again 2 hours later because they forgot about it.

This generous policy during COVID times really made me very thankful and they deserve praise for it. That bumps up the review overall though, because the in air experience is not great. The on ground experience is perfect, with great boarding, great staff support, great call support, great privilege club benefits and so on. But in the air, I was greeted with an oldish plane and subpar seating. The seats were somehow smaller than even I've become accustomed to in recent years. The entertainment system was alright but slightly laggy, and the headphones provided were awful. The food was of acceptable quality, though the lunch provided between the two meals was subpar (it was a boring, bland roll.) The wifi is only 10 dollars but privilege club members get one hour for free. I believe students get it for free in general but I wasn't able to get that to work.

Thought I could upgrade from Economy to Business, but their Privilege Club is further degrading and has abolished that option. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to pay and book online due to increased security causing it to be a several days’ project to issue a ticket. Award tickets cannot be booked without instantly paying taxes. And, online payments could not be effected from Rwanda due to code/country problems to receive OTP. Thus, even temporarily bookings can’t be made unless done directly by QR over phone at higher fares and lots of troubles involving use of other people’s credit cards. Check-In in Kigali easy, though must be in Airport 4 hours prior to departure due to Corona prevention measures. Granted Lounge access to Pearl lounge which is acceptable. Must pay for luxury beverages. But a variety of hot food and snacks offered makes up for it. All flights on B-787-8. Long haul Economy Class QR is top notch and matches economy+ on other airlines. They have improved economy class services since I travelled with them last time; 18 months ago. FAs are attentive and extremely concerned of elite travellers like myself – I have a fainting Gold Card, but was addressed by name throughout I was given the best seats possible in economy among options provided. Drinks were offered frequently. Call bells responded to quickly. Three choices of hot food on every long leg: plenty of it, and I got more if requested. No seafood, mutton, fish or exotic meat offered. English breakfast without bacon? Salads average and desserts were excellent. Sparkling wine (Cava) and wines. Beers offered are still embarrassing: only two, similar, dull lagers offered: Stella Artois and Budweiser – Heineken has gone but that does not add to the repertoire, anyway. The leg DOH-CPH offered two meal rounds. First, a Champagne brunch (3 meal options). Then, a heavy sandwich prior to descend. I was given 3 seats through seat-block for elite travellers. FFP-lounges in Doha are temporarily upgraded to become the Al Mourjan - even for economy travelers with card status. In CPH my luggage came out as the first. A pleasant travel.

The reservations system is clumsy and full of frustrating redundancies in terms of data input. You need to re-enter country of residence and nationality at payment time despite having done that already for the booking.  The problems arise when there is a bug and it becomes unavoidable to deal with a human operator. And this is where the nightmare starts. The operators, while usually courteous, are unable to do anything useful. In our case, they kept telling us there was nothing wrong with our corrupt data. In one instance, calling the Swiss desk, my call was broken and they would hang it up as we tried to call back. The Doha call center was easier to talk to, but they could not see, let alone fix the data problems. They made us believe that problems would be fixed at check-in or at the transit desk. Upon reaching the Doha stopover around midnight, we got kicked around from desk to desk (transit, to lounge, to ticketing, to upgrade before you fly. And at every stop,  ""we can't help you here, but no worries, your solution is at the next stop"". Nobody did the right thing when a system error is causing additional cost or reduced opportunity. On our previous trip, we checked-in to the Doha Al-Mourjan lounge with two paid up vouchers of which one was mysteriously not showing in their system. They treated us like suspects of having forged the voucher, it took 45 minutes of misery at 1 AM, with them absolutely refusing to let us take a rest while they investigated the bug, despite us offering them to take a debit on our credit card as a safety.  On the latest flight with them, we spent a night in Doha on a chair in a crowded, noisy hall because of the bug that prevented us for 10 days from booking the lounge which was part of planning this trip.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,August 2021,Boeing 777,Male to Zurich via Doha,Male,Doha,Zurich,1.0,no

We are glad that we chose Qatar Airways who made us feel safe and relieved. Transfer desk staff at Montreal were friendly and helpful in sorting out some last minute challenges on travel clearance. They gave us a meal voucher since all business class lounges were closed in Montreal airport. Boarding was streamlined to ensure social distance. Upon boarding the crew introduced and explained the cabin features. The amenity kid, COVID PPE kit, duvet were all ready at the seat and the crew offered the pyjamas. We chose the refreshing lemon mint signature drink prior to take off. The Qsuite is truly a first class business class suite with great comfort and privacy, could not ask for anything more. The couple suite rear facing was great offering us more personal space with the divider removed. The beverage and meal service was prompt and on demand. We miss the trolley service where you get to choose the options and appreciate the presentation but that is understandable during COVID times. One of the cabin crew was convincing my wife hard to have the breakfast since she skipped the dinner service. The crew wear their full PPE including gown and safety glasses and the passengers are required to wear masks at all times. The washrooms were kept clean at all times, however I felt the A350 washrooms bit smaller than the B777 ones. The transit experience in Hamad airport was smooth and refreshing. The 3 hours went by quick with shower facilities, spacious seating options and dining options on the upper level.

The attendants service and food and beverages quality are the highest standards I have ever experienced in the industry. For me, Qatar Airways is definitely the best airline for Business Class.

Changing our tickets was simplicity and the person dealing with the change was very helpful. Checking in at Sydney was average with the check in staff doubling up with gate duties, there were only four flights departing Sydney that evening so they weren't exactly rushed off their feet. The flight was uneventful which is how you want it. The service was exemplary, very attentive and the food was delicious with plenty of it. The seat although lie flat wasn't as comfortable as I was expecting and on the 14 hour flight I got somewhere between 2-3 hours of sleep. The in flight entertainment was average with few major movies available. We had three hours at Doha before catching our onward flight to Heathrow and we used most of the three hours in the spacious lounge refreshing ourselves. The onward flight was a repeat of the first flight, generally pleasant with the same caveats as before. Overall the onboard experience was very good. But what marred the flight was after we got to our isolation destination to find out an expensive electrical item had been badly damaged despite it being marked as fragile.

I went and sat down and called my family in Malaysia and told them about my situation and at the sane time going online to find out what the requirement was to enter Malaysia even though I’m a Malaysian citizen. Apparently, it’s a letter that I have to sign in order to undertake to pay for my quarantine in Malaysia (which didn’t apply to me as I was going home to my state of Sarawak and Sarawak would bear all my quarantine expenses since I’m a Sarawakian). My family advised me to call my cousin’s daughter who is an immigration officer in Kuala Lumpur. I was just about to call her when one of the gate agents called me back to the podium. Apparently, one of the Qatar Airways employee working that day thought outside the box, went online to the Malaysian website and printed out that letter for me. I filled out my particulars and signed it in front of her. She handed it to me and told me to hand it to the Malaysian authorities when I arrive.

Qatar Airways seems to be taking the pandemic very seriously, which is great to see, as they supplied us with spare masks, gloves and hand sanitiser, all complimentary. Frustratingly, the screens at London Heathrow stated “flight closing” when the flight hadn’t even started boarding yet, and this caused a number of passengers to panic considering the huge size of Terminal 5 and the amount of time it can take to cross the terminal to get to your gate. I was very surprised with how spacious the aircraft was. There was plenty of leg room and it was great to see Qatar Airways adhere to social distancing regulations - no two passengers were seated next to one another unless travelling as a group. The meal services provided onboard were fantastic. They had more selection than other airlines I’ve flown with in the past. Cabin crew were generally very welcoming and friendly.

Obviously was very much looking to the return flights, but due to cancellation due to the Coronavirus, this did not happen and flew back with Air Mauritius to London Heathrow (review to follow). The flights however will be delayed and will use them in the next 12 months on another Qatar Airways Flight, if they decline my request for a refund. In all, a great experience. Much better than Emirates for sure in terms of cost, baggage allowance and cabin service.

I know that if I fly a smaller A319 from Bucharest to Doha for example or an A380, 777 or A350 long haul, that the cabin crew will be just as polished and polite on each service and the aircraft turned out immaculately.

I am looking forward to flying on the A350-1000 in a few weeks time and will continue to fly Qatar where I can, for me they are the benchmark airline in the industry for onboard service. The one downside for me is their Rewards program which I think is very rigid and overly taxing in terms of reward points they charge for upgrades etc and what they give as rewards.

The meals and wines were excellent and the FAs quietly attentive. The business class layout of the A350 is virtually identical to the Boeing 787 Qatar Airways used to fly on the Edinburgh route, but I found the Airbus generally quite a bit more comfortable.

Checkin was easy, although I hadn’t realised we could have used the Business Class counter with oneWorld Ruby status. Boarding is regimentally administered by zone. We chose the 2 abreast J/K seats on the A380 which requires walking the length of the main deck economy cabin the up the rear stairs. That small cabin at the rear of the upper deck was a good choice. Very quiet, and I like the extra storage space beside the K seat. We received a good blanket and pillow on both flights, plus a small amenity pack for the long overnight flight from SYD containing eyeshades, earplugs, sockettes, toothbrush and lip balm. Service was performed by the same crew member for the whole trip, same from Doha to Nice which I liked. The crew appeared very professional but our ladies were a little robotic. Food was adequate, with numerous drink and snack runs. I appreciated the attention to detail. Eg. asked for cranberry juice during one meal and when advised not available, was offered 3 other juice options which was fine by me. 10 minutes later, a cranberry juice was delivered. One annoying occurrence was when they changed us from 18K/19K to 19J/K from Doha, after we had been given boarding passes in Sydney. Not wanting a middle seat, the only alternative to a middle seat was an aisle further back. I think they fibbed telling us it was so a family could sit together. They weren’t in row 18.

Manchester - Doha I was given seat 37A - window exit seat. Which was VERY nice of the ground staff. They didn’t have to do this but I think the man could already see at check in that I was afraid. The seat was comfortable. I’m a fairly chubby lady, however I fit into the seat great and the seat belt and person next to me all was totally fine. The flight was a little bumpy but I was kept entertained by watching the cabin staff - watching them keep calm during turbulence stops me from being so scared. I didn’t eat during the flight as I find it too hard to eat during bumpy times as it worries me even more - silly I know, but. My passenger next to me however had a pack of pretzels soon as we took off, a chicken lunch around 1 hour after take off, then about 1 hour before arrival had a chicken pastry. There were drinks served at the same time. I had a gin - to calm nerves ;). Juice, water and Pepsi. Staff lovely. Had a lady from Ghana serving mostly. Arrived on time with smooth landing. Doha airport is massive  for those who have not ever been. Very nice ground staff at the gate. Doha to Auckland was even more bumpy. Constance low level turbulence with at times the seat belt signs coming on. Again on time landing despite leaving Doha around 20/30 mins late due to long take off queue at Doha (even at 2.30am). Breakfast was served about 1 hour after take off, then dinner around 5 hours. Snack box in between, a hot pastry in between and then  breakfast around 1 hour before arrival. I actually ate the second breakfast, I had the sausage and eggs. I ate the sausage but left the eggs and potatoes as not to my taste. Also had a coffee, orange juice, croissant, bag of apple slices and yogurt. Very good indeed. The flight attendant could see I wasn’t eating due to the bumpy conditions and kindly left me the snack box while I slept under my seat which had chocolate, granola bar, juice, pretzels etc. Furthermore, the flight attendants were absolutely lovely when I pressed the buzzer multiple times asking for water - again due to being afraid of flying I don’t like to stand up on flights. The cabin crew came around with boxes of popcorn / crisps during the flight as ‘movie snacks’. Such a nice touch!! Although i didn’t eat, the people next to me said the food was delicious. I can’t watch the tv whilst on the flight as I wear pressurising EarPods (I can’t hear anything at all). But the films were great; they had new films like dumbo live action & avengers endgame. Loads of games which I did play. As well as 1 hour free WiFi or WiFi for the whole flight for $10. Great connection much better than Emirates. For Emirates connection usually I can only access iMessage. However with Qatar I was able to go on Facebook, Snapchat and instagram with no issues at all. Probably on my flight home I will pay the $10 for my whole flight as it puts me at ease being able to talk to family and friends. Nice toiletries bag on the long flight with toothbrush, socks, eye mask, toothpaste and lip balm. The flight from U.K. to doha was 7 hrs while to Auckland was just over 16 hours.

2019-07-31,10.0,10.0,Noreesha Ottali,Oman,"""Qsuite on the A350 is amazing""","  Considering the overall flying time from Muscat to Houston via Doha was 19 hours or so I was dreading to do it in an economy class flight. However do to pricing factors for a business class ticket, I transferred my amazing American Express membership reward points to my QA account and credited it with miles. After having done that I called up the call centre who said there weren't any seats available for miles. I was disappointed as  I had already transferred my amex points out by then. As my date of travel arrived, departed Muscat to Doha on economy I had a 2.5 hr transit in doha and felt like trying my luck at the customer service counter.  Unfortunately my hope for an upgrade via miles was not entertained by the lady stating I was not eligible. Not giving up i was directed by another  staff to head to the counter where the security checks were. One staff typed away on his system started making calls and told me theres just one seat available which only could be released after confirmation from his team which would just one hour prior to departure. Keeping my fingers crossed 10 minutes later he told me I was able to avail the upgrade! The efforts made by Ahmed were so remarkable that I insisted I raise this to the management that staff like this should be admired and rewarded for such excellent service and should be role models. The gesture made such a difference to the whole trip as the Qsuite on the A350 is an amazing experience and I think it's a better than even the A380 business having the double bed feel side by side to your partner is wonderful. We've shared our experience with friends and family stating it's not just a 5 star service on board meeting the right staff gave us a 5 star service on ground too.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,July 2019,A350,Muscat to Houston via Doha,Muscat,Doha,Houston,1.0,Yes

Inflight entertainment might be bit better, especially on A330 equipment where screens are old. I noticed the A330 had fewer lavatories. But what is absolutely the best when it comes to Qatar Airways are the meals and drinks. You have an outstanding choice of three main courses. Cold drinks served twice on ARN-DOH leg. And hot drinks also twice. Ability to select seats for free or ask (if you have a very short connection in Doha for example, to chose a front aisle seat). Boarding procedures were easy and simple. Both flights were on time and it is the most important thing. Ground service is awesome thanks to the Hamad Airport which is an ingenious facility designed around the passenger's very needs of any kind.

2019-07-27,10.0,10.0,K Lee,Thailand,"""the best of the best"""," I do not regret choosing Qatar Airways at all. Almost everything was the best of the best! I was also lucky enough to be able to fly Qsuite, which is easily the best way to travel. Check in at Bangkok Airport is quite a mess, due to the fact that there are four flights leaving simultaneously to Doha. The check in agent said that the Qatar Airways lounge in Bangkok is closed due to a cracked window. I was about to head to the JAL lounge when I noticed that the Qatar lounge was in fact, open and fully operational. This lounge was absolutely immaculate. They even had Bollinger champagne! There was a buffet service and most drinks were actually made on request to the staff. They were there to help you with everything. I think the staff to passenger ratio was 1:1. My favourite thing at this lounge has to be the Baklava. Qatar also has their lounge literally next door to their main competition, Singapore Airlines. Boarding was orderly on the outbound flights from Bangkok to Doha and Johannesburg, but on the return they instead asked economy passengers to board first, their reason being ""The cabin was not ready for business class passengers."" The good bits: Qsuite! We were a family of four, so we elected to have the first ""Quad"" seat which is essentially a conference room with closed doors! We were in our own private world up there. The seat/bed was super comfortable, although watch out for row two, as this row has slightly less foot space due to the angle of the cabin. There was a thin mattress cover provided and my mum and dad were even able to sleep together in the double bed! The regular 1-2-1 business class found on the A350 and B787 was also excellent. I would strongly suggest reserving row 7 on the A350, as you get two extra cubbies next to you for your belongings. Also located close but not too close to the toilets. The flat bed on these seats were also excellent, and there were endless seat adjustments. the ""bar"" on these planes was filled with snacks, fruit and champagne and most of the time there was a flight attendant waiting there to assist you. The service: I cannot emphasise this more, it surpassed all expectations I had set. Every single item was placed at your seat, no trays were used at all. The flight attendants were all friendly and professional. They seem to know the types of passengers very well and how to treat them. I had a cold on my return trip, and was constantly looked after. On one of the flights, a medical emergency was declared and the crew handled the situation very calmly and professionally. Once the flight landed there was already an ambulance waiting for the sick passenger. The food: Everything I tasted was excellent, and I took advantage of their dine on demand service by ordering a hot snack in the middle of the flight. I think my favourite meal was a Philly Cheesesteak which was very filling and the beef was very tender. They give every passenger (Including economy) 1 hour free wifi onboard! The Al Mourjan lounge in Doha: To call it huge is an understatement. This lounge is absolutely gigantic! You also had a personal tablet at every seat for information on the airport or flight information. Too bad everything is too spaced out. Given the fact that all airlines have their ups and downs, I would say that Qatar is an excellent airline and it shows in almost every way. I would certainly choose them because of their extensive network, but they haven't won me completely over. Yet I'd give them a 11 if i could!",Family Leisure,Business Class,July 2019,"Boeing 777-300ER, A350-900, Boeing 787-8",Bangkok to Johannesburg via Doha,Bangkok,Doha,Johannesburg,1.0,Yes

There was no queue and complete in 5 minutes. I was given my boarding pass and advised to use for it for the fast track and Lounge. I headed to the lounge where I was greeted by a member of staff who seemed awkward. I was the first to arrive and i think caught them off guard. Quickly from a side door appeared a chap arranging his tie and who welcomed me, taking my boarding pass and scanning it. I soon realised the first person to greet me was a lounge attendant and was perhaps a little embarrassed that the reception chap was not ready. I enjoyed the breakfast and relaxed for a while until boarding was ready. I was welcomed and shown to my seat where the crew offered to put my bag in the overhead locker. I was then left for a few minutes to settle in before crew returned and offered a welcome drink. As it was a holiday, at 07.30 i went for Champagne! Menu was then Brought around before a short time later crew came and discussed when would like to eat. Qatar offer dine on demand so you eat when you want but they check with you your initial intentions which i think is great. Departure from LHR was delayed which meant an very quick connection in Doha where the flight was boarding when i arrived. DOH is smooth. On arrival there was a lady calling out for Bangkok who duly wrote the gate number on my boarding pass and advised to proceed to the gate. Doha to Bangkok was a late flight so i slept and arrived in to BKK fresh. My return to LHR was two weeks or so later. BKK was again a day flight. I would say they need more staff at check in at Suvarnabhumi. There were 2 counters business class side but that also included economy bag drop. There were 2 couples ahead of me and a queue for bag drop but business class trumped the bag drop people which was a respectable touch. It took about 15 minutes compared to LHR 5 mins. Again service on QSuite was great. Drink, menu, chocolates. Staff friendly and will chat. I often feel crew just go through then motions but actually on Qatar if you engage them they will happily chat. I spoke to some about where they were from, being based in Doha, stopover etc. It seems most only have about 24 hours once they arrive where they land - greulling. Flight from DOH to LHR was lacklustre. Boarding was chaotic. everyone moves forward, economy class not listening to their instructions to wait for their zone to be called. Initially only one staff scanning boarding passes who had to keep shouting Business class passengers only. Anyway once on board it started well. Drink brought, towel, menu. Order taken after take off which was fine, but they let themselves down by being the slowest service i have ever ever had. I had anticipated a quick bite to eat before getting a sleep in as i had to drive home on arrival -2 hours. We took off at 15.50 and i had'nt finished eating over halfway through the flight. Wine and nuts came - great i thought. It took 20 minutes for the amouse bouche to follow. Then when he came to clear I thought the soup would follow shortly. I was wrong. It took about another 15 minutes. It was all very slow and with my frustration clear, when I said I wish to sleep he said he would give me make the bed and gave me a set of pyjamas to change into.

And  WiFi Is  cheap on Qatar Airways! 30 Minutes for free, and only 10USD for the duration of the flight, no matter how long.

It was a good chicken pizza sandwich, not the dry chicken sandwiches they used to serve.

I realised after making the booking it was not possible to fly together (as 3 bookings) and had to insist at the airport to be seated together.

That’s where the nightmare started. I had a connecting flight to Hamburg, and was informed a day later that they were not willing to deliver to my home. I have to collect the baggage from Hamburg airport. Since it’s a long way from my home to Hamburg, I have not been able to collect the bag yet and it’s day 5 after arrival. I think the airlines should take full responsibility if baggage is lost. No response to my emails....the same applies to phone calls...where I was told that reservation got nothing to do with it. The handling agent insists that I collect the baggage myself.

Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I don’t like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. It’s not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue. Overall flight was excellent although very slight downgrades in quality, and price increases are making this not quite as appealing for leisure travellers.

2019-05-08,9.0,10.0,Alan Stone,Australia,"""the best we have ever had in economy class"""," Unbelievable level of personalised service even in the cheap seats. My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) . Qatar Airways have now won my long haul business. Unfortunately with no direct Melbourne Singapore or Melbourne Vietnam services I am still shackled to SQ whose standards have been slipping for the last 3 years.

The Purser in charge never introduced herself or said goodbye, nothing. The lady in charge of my section was obviously hating her job. No smile, very slow and chaotic service, wine was served after the main course. My seat could not move 2h before arrival and I had to sit on the bed for breakfast.

Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good.

I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles.  The  inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage.  The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options.  A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused. All in, this was better than my last few experiences on Qatar, and I wouldn't tell friends to avoid them.

The Airbus A350-1000 is the latest addition to Qatar Airways' fleet, with its Q Suites that have been raved as the best business class product in the world. In my opinion, it is indeed the best business class product I experienced to date. First and Business Class passengers had their own vast premium check-in area and, not a separate line but a separate security screening facility, which made the whole process peaceful and seamless. The lounge at Doha airport was huge and beautiful. It was quite crowded when I came as it took me a while to find a dining table. However, it did not seem like a chronic issue as it was cleared shortly after. Food offerings were OK, not inspiring providing this was their home base. The gate area, though, was tight and crowded, but I think that was more about the airport. However, as QR is the main operator of the airport, I am surprised why they do not exercise their influence on the design of the gate, which has just been recently completed, to match their excellent service. My Q Suite, in my opinion, was the most intelligently designed business class seat I have seen (those included AA, DL, UA, CX, CI, JL, RJ, BR, TK, BA, OZ, VN, KE, GA and more). The suite may have appeared a bit claustrophobic with the door closed, but it felt totally different with generous shoulder room and hip room, which made sleeping so easy and comfortable.

The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned.  We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for.

The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices.

Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. Choice of hot and cold towels were offered at take off and landing. Amenities kit was a hard shell bag, pink in color. Arrival was at Terminal 8 at JFK which is very good compared to the other terminals - in terms of space, facilities, and quickness of official services.

The cabin crew for this particular flight were outstanding and made up for the issues with the ground staff! This particular flight featured quite possibly the worst turbulence I have ever endured in my life--and I once flew through a typhoon. The flight attendants managed to serve us meals during one of the bumpiest parts of the flight and did not drop or spill anything. They continued to smile and politely ask passengers if they needed anything else. One even offered me a special meal which another passenger had not shown up for!  I am a big fan of Qatar Airways--so much so that I endure 8 hour long layovers in Doha every time I fly with them, just because the experience is wonderful every time.

Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for £590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss.

The B777 from Canberra are now the “Suites” version - as impressive as many reviewers have already reported and the onboard service - personal attention, food, beverage (see further comment below), in flight entertainment, ambience and comfort - as many have already stated is unmatched. My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested). After the short 30 minute hop to Sydney all passengers are required to disembark with all their carry-on. There are no further formalities at SYD, disembarkation being directly into the departures concourse; there is ample time to get to the QANTAS BC lounge ard have lunch if so desired. The 15 hour flight post SYD had only one low point from Qatar’s otherwise outstanding point of view, despite the glossy wine and beverage menu (two champagnes, three whites, three reds with a “stickey” and a port plus beers, spirits and soft drinks) within four hours, and still over Australia, the whites had been exhausted.

At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently.

One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines.

Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge, I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee.",Business,Business Class,May 2018,Boeing 777 / 787,Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha,Shanghai,Doha,Stockholm,1.0,Yes

Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from.

Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777.

At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn’t sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus!

They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake.

The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping. The entertainment system could have a bigger selection of movies and the browsing the selection should be available via the main screen instead of the touch screen equipped remote control.

2018-03-20,3.0,10.0,Hugh Colton,United States,Qatar Airways customer review,"  Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha.  Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld  members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft.  My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic. I was unimpressed with Qatar Airways and next year when we visit Bhutan we will use a different OneWorld carrier.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,March 2018,Boeing 777,Doha to Atlanta,Doha,Direct,Atlanta,1.0,no

After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn’t complete torture. It’s up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I’d say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don’t have access to the regular business class lounge but  a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn’t matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it’s open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it’s economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I’ll be seeking out again.

I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar’s service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don’t give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone.

You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew’s attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there’s less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve.

The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid.

However, our return journey from Sydney on 19 November was a disaster. We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed. Around lunchtime, another passenger I spoke to advised me to check under manage booking on the website; when I did, to my surprise I found I had been booked on a flight via Beijing in less than an hour, and never told. By the time we got to check in, we'd missed that. There were no Qatar staff at the airport, but eventually we did get through to a call centre, and finally got rerouted on Qantas to London. Qatar has made no effort to contact us since - I'd hope they'd at least refund what we spent on phone calls.

I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers -  it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too.

Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class.

On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed. I had been bumped from the quick connection (1 hour 10m) in Doha onto a flight which left an hour and a half later. My arrival time at LHR would now be 10pm instead of 8.25pm; a real inconvenience for me. As it was Sunday afternoon in Bali, there was no office open to call and ask why the change. I tried the London and Doha offices; both were closed. The flight I had been bumped off was still being advertised online as being available to book, but I could do nothing, so I spent an hour making arrangements involving costly calls to the UK from Bali. I checked in early the next day and asked at the desk to put me back on the original flight. At first, the desk staff said they could not help me and I'd have to speak to the transfer desk in Doha, but once the question of which flight my bag would be checked to, came up (with me refusing to allow it to be on the later flight),  they were able to check me on to the earlier flight. I lost all my seat selections with a change of aircraft, and ended up on the undesirable window seats on both legs of the 777-300. The stewardess told me that the aircraft was changed 3 weeks before the flight; again, there was no notification about the change and that my allocated seats were no longer available. Neither of my two legs had internet on board. My arrival in Doha was delayed by half an hour so I had 40 minutes, along with 21 other passengers, to get to the next flight. We made it easily; however, I deeply regret getting onboard for the following: The mystery of being bumped was solved; much of the aircraft's business class section was occupied by a local family along with their appallingly behaved children of various ages. For 7 hours, non-stop, we were bombarded by toddlers running around or screaming to each other across rows of seats, by their staff running in and out of economy trying to control the children, by people swapping seats constantly and by members of the family bringing more toddlers and babies from other cabins to socialise. This wasn't a business class experience; it was being in a creche for a day. The cabin crew were beside themselves with trying to control the situation.

Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented.

Eventually, at check-in, I upgraded to business class for miles (“Q-credits”). This was easy, and I had only to wait 5 Minutes until the flight manager could confirm that the appropriate food could be availed within this short notice of only 2½ hours. It worked out and I signed a form to deduct Q-credits from my FFP programme.

No pre-departure champagne offered – only for CPH and CDG in Europe champagne is not served pre-departure? Food was so, so and tasteless. Drinks and wine list were excellent, served upon take off with hot nuts and hot towels. New onboard is an Italian beer Peroni, which is quite good and tasty.

On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles.

Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour. Meals were good, staff were great - very friendly, toilets were always clean.

I had only flown on Economy once before as the other time I had an economy seat they upgraded me. All in all, not bad for a short hop. I was, however, irked just after take off when I asked for a beer and was refused, on the apparent basis that they did not serve alcohol on local Middle East flights. I know that upfront I would have been sipping Champagne by then. Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have  10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on.

It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again.

Flights were on time and service was good. Doha airport deserted due to the ongoing blockage and due to Ramadan. QR tackles the crises well by preponing some of the connecting flights from Doha to avoid delays due to excessive lengths of routings avoiding unfriendly airspace. Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game. Onboard, lengthy safety video shown with Barcelona FC become boring after being unchanged for several years. I am puzzled by the intrusive charity propaganda and money collection attempt by introducing ""Educate a Child"" propaganda without providing any facts and prove of efficiency.

Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi. Immigration was busy but got the bags and out to the taxi in 45 minutes. Qatar pushes things to a new level- even when flying them in coach it's pleasant.

On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset.  The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad.  For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience.

Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good.

What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat.

Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered.

As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very, very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 787-8, flight on time. Contact-gate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft.

The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic.  Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy.  She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the  red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me.

A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not.

He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s.

Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware?  Plenty of individual entertainment options; a nice seat pack that included eyeshades, ear plugs,and other goodies; good blanket; good earphones, etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies - and maybe as a result (or else we had exceptional parents, babies and children both ways), little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long, exhausting flights). I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again, and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class, but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing: Next time, I intend to make a stopover in Doha, especially on the way back, because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return, maybe due to time differences, we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover, because from the airport, on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours. There is an airport hotel, but it is also easy to arrange to stay over for a day or two.

From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner.  The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest.

However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes).

I chose Qatar Airways as I was very curious about the Dreamliner that Boeing and many people were talking about. I wanted to feel for myself the spacious layout, the more natural cabin pressure closer to the ground, and the larger colour-changing windows. When I boarded the aircraft, there was a little lounge between the business and the economy classes, so it did feel very spacious. The design of the over-head luggage compartments also made it feel more spacious than other aircraft when you standing in the aisle. Were the windows larger? I was not sure - maybe, as I could see the ground from my aisle seat. There was definitely a difference in the cabin pressure - during taking-off and landing, I did not feel any pain in my ears. The leg room was not tight, but somehow I did not feel it was as comfortable as I was imagining. I just felt lack of support on my back and my feet never feel too relaxed. Also, there was a box under the front seat in all A and C seats (I guess it is the same for the other side, too), taking up quite a lot of space. In terms of the service, it was pretty good. One of my stereo earphone jacks in 19H did not work, so the flight attendants changed me to 20D. The food was OK, but far from amazing.

Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed.

I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive,  the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge. Any negatives only that I seem to have lost my privilege club silver status, have to check my points.

Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none.

The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights.

However, the entertainment system technology needs a lot of thought - the right button on one of my co-passenger's screen didn't work which left her with only 4/5 movie options and was very annoying. Even though they have a great selection, the hardware needs an upgrade. The call attendant button or light button did not work on my seat remote control. Also, I had multiple issues with air hostesses both on Mumbai-Doha and Doha-Atlanta leg. Even after the call attendant button was pressed, none of the air-hostesses paid attention and I had to call them while they were passing by in the aisle. I could see 3-4 other attendant lights switched on but nobody came by for 10 minutes or so.  The meal timings were really bad. After they served us brunch at 11:30 AM Doha time, no food was served till almost 6 PM. Having reached Doha at 5 AM, just having 1 meal till evening was not what I had in mind.

The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 3/4 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row, especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you can't lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15+ hour flight from Doha, we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am, we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later. They came around with drinks several times and our choice was a juice or water, drinks were served at room temperature no ice was provided. After 8 hours from breakfast they served us a small chicken or vegetarian pasty with a small brownie; a fuller selection of drinks was offered, no ice unless you asked.  After 6 hours with no snacks they offered a dinner. I thought the food service was meager and food quality was average, snacks were nearly non existent. Drink choices during the flight were minimal, the lack of ice was disappointing. I picked Qatar Airways because I read many glowing reviews about extra service and space, but found the flight in economy very average. The entertainment options were very good, but my remote on the trip to Johannesburg did not work properly, on the return trip the remote would not stay in place and hung down on the back of the seat. On the 8 hour flight to Johannesburg they offered after departure and a small pastry after 7 hours, no other snacks were offered. There are 4 bathrooms on the Boeing 777 in economy and nearly a constant line of people waiting to use them. We ran out of hand towels on my flight after about 5 hours.

On the way back, one seat was left vacant, totally wasted. So, the moral of the story is, don't bother booking seats. They gave our away seats for some unknown reasons and wouldn't change them back.

Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats.

We and other people ending up boarding last on the plane.  Upon arrival for transit at DOH, we were greeted with the sign that passengers to KUL please report to staff. We learned, from the first staff that our flight was overbooked by 50 people. For pax from Munich, they decided to bump us to the next flight. They offered us $250 voucher (not cash) and get on the next plane which will arrive 8 hours later. As that means we will miss the connecting flight and they do not offer to compensate for that connecting flight, we refused the offer. Also, how come it impacted us when we checked in successfully not even 6 hours before. There were several group of passengers. Then the story change, it is not overbooked but technical difficulties. After heated arguments with the ground staff, we indeed can get into the plane, the seat next to me at the plane is empty.

Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar. We've also seen dates where Qatar is considerably cheaper than Emirates.

This was an insult to other passengers in Business Class and felt like being at a busy McDonalds for 7½ hrs. May we suggest Qatar Airways to introduce quiet zones on your aircraft for people who want to relax and enjoy a quality experience in peace and quiet? This has happened several times over the years and, unfortunately, on QR as well: some families are simply unable to make the distinction between their homes and public places nor seem to have the capacity to think about others who would like to enjoy their flights - or just take a rest.

Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH.

Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in’s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class.  Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice.  I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I’d prefer chairs to sofas – and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, “Aspire”, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN.

Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits. The senior flight attendant was helpful setting up my phone for the on-board wi-fi. Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife. On arrival in NY, each one came to say goodbye to the passengers which I thought was very graceful. The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration.

The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant.

This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year (after traveling with Emirates in 2015) I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available, neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year, nor during flight from Doha to Colombo. These are not very big problems, but they have left me thinking it was only two years, so many changes and all of them for the worse.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,May 2016,"A320, A349",WAW to CMB via DOH,Warsaw Chopin Airport,Doha,Colombo,1.0,no

The seats in row one seemed to have a larger foot rest area. The inflight entertainment had a lot less choice than on the Boeing 787. No wifi on this plane. The dining experience was the same as on my previous report from Manchester to Doha but the menu was different. As the flight departed at 2.30am, we chose a light meal and then had something more substantial near the end of the flight. On demand dining allowed you to chose what you want and when you have it.

I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening.

We were informed we would need to pay a very large sum of money to move to the next flight although we are premium and the class ticket was the exact same. It was this or cancel the holiday and pay for a flight back to Dubai until then they refused to release our bags - we paid the large amount and paid for hotels. On the return leg I requested the cabin crew to make the bed, I had my phone charging in the side panel. I slept and on awaking I went to take my phone to find it down the side of the bed. To my horror it was crushed to peices, I can only assume that when making the bed it was moved and the seat moved to create the bed so crushing it, the seat was not moved in any way before or after.

Business class trip to Oman, and on departure from Heathrow they held the plane for an hour and a half for late arriving passengers (so announced the pilot to the passengers). Didn't make any time up in the air, and on landing at Doha it meant half the plane missed our connections, including me, which meant being stranded in Qatar for a night. Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight. The shocking thing is that on return no one cared an ounce about the fact their decision to hold the plane in London - not weather or mechanical. I asked for compensation for the $21 I had to spend on their hotel's Internet and was refused. True customer service shows through when things go badly and Qatar failed in this case.

I therefore printed off our boarding passes to Brussels two days before the flight as requested.

If Qatar had sent us an email to inform us that our flights had been cancelled, we might have been able to find much more suitable alternatives in time.

Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch.  Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short. Hamad Airport wasn't quite what I had hoped for. One positive note; Doha is not as busy as Dubai. Doha to Bangkok was on the fantastic A380. This flight was very good and I was lucky again and given a seat on the upper deck economy section (seat 25b). The seat was in front of the bulkhead and offered me extra legroom ones again. Smooth flight (or rather a nice inflight sleep). The return flight from Bangkok to Doha was an A380 again and was uneventfull. At Suvarnabhumi it took the ground staff quite some time to realise that their check at boarding wasn't going to work with only 1 staff member checking passports and boarding cards. After some time another staff member came and checks went quicker and the flight could depart on time. On arrival in Doha no security check, off the airplane into the terminal. The flight from Doha to Amsterdam was now on a new Boeing 777 with 10 seat abreast. Still not bad and I was happy I didn't have to sit on that awful 787. Nice flight and another fine crew.

Leg room was very acceptable especially as my husband is over 6 feet tall. Entertainment offered was the same on all 4 flights, but was varied and there was plenty to choose from. The airport at Doha was beautiful and its' structure was much admired by my consultant structural engineer husband. On the return flight we had an 8 hour layover at Doha so decided to book the Airport Hotel for 5-8 hour slot. A little pricey but well worth having a rest and a swim for nearly an hour in a stunning pool on the 4th floor overlooking the concourse.

One point they were handing out chicken sandwiches but turned out to be a pastry filled with mush. Staff were okay, they weren't smiling. At least 8 hours into the flight, they eventually handed out small bottles of water. But flight was good, no turbulence, smooth landing in Doha. I was looking forward to a flight on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner but they changed it to a Boeing 777-300er. London to Doha I flew the A380. Great aircraft, good legroom for economy, food was sort of the same, except they handed out a decent chocolate bar. Entertainment systems newer than the 777. They were great, I watched a few movies and slept most of the time. Then another smooth landing at Doha. I was impressed of the A380. Another Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Perth.

Passengers in the small economy section at the rear of the top deck are entirely separate and not allowed to use the lounge or wander through the business area. The cabin service and food was faultless. Qatar Airways cabin staff are specifically trained for the A380 and it certainly shows.

Maybe they shouldn't over play dining options and (wonderful) spirit and wine choices. The rose champagne was finished before take off in AMS. Being patriotic I ordered a Glenfiddich as my post departure drink from SGN and there wasn't any. The Meursault wine was finished after one glass out of AMS and SGN. On each occasion I was told they would try to get me my dining options subject to what their colleague had been asked for in the other aisle. I formed the impression that there was calculated stocking of food and using up depleted stocks of their excellent drinks cellar. I spoke to the cabin director on one matter. The business class seat layout of the Boeing 787 is 1x2x1. My wife and I sat in the middle with the children on either side. It was clear we were travelling together but they could not comprehend that my wife and I would want to dine together and insisted that we take service at different times from different crew.

Easy boarding, on a Boeing 777, nice welcome by a crew member who showed us to our seats. Same comfort and lie flat bed as on the outward flight. I chose more international food, it was a light dinner due to late departure (10pm), nothing fantastic but good and nice presentation, all dishes brought to your seat, no trolley up and down the aisle. I watched two films. Could sleep well and had ordered a light breakfast which was served 90 mins before landing. Arriving at Doha at 4am, access by jetway but long way to walk, time to walk to the lounge, hardly anybody there, it was 0430 - went upstaors to restaurant which starts at 5am. Could get some tea at once then chose the buffet which I found more attractive than a la carte menu. I had a nice full breakfast out of a large choice of western and oriental style products. Then a shower, no waiting, though lounge was getting more crowded with several flights arriving. 4hr layover went as a breeze, with waiting time in a quiet and comfortable place, with good wifi connection and power socket to charge iphone and ipad.

Twice crew asked if I wanted extra drinks or food. Landing at Stockholm, some walk thru immigration to reach luggage delivery, our cases arrived on belt less than 5 minutes after we had been there.

The passenger was found to be fit to travel and we departed 2 hours late. This meant we missed our connecting flight at Doha for the onward leg to the Maldives. What made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at Doha when we landed, but couldn't be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. On arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at Doha at 7.30am. We were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of Doha (the Golden Ocean), which seemed like a 2 star hotel. We tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site - there was constant drilling and hammering all day long.  Not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery, as we couldn't change into clean clothes. We were collected at 10pm for the flight to the Maldives which departed at 1am. No member of staff apologised at any time - we felt abandoned. We missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered.

Threee different aircraft types all fairly new, well-kept, and well-functioning. All flights on time. FA's hardworking, focused, and up to the game. Quality of catering is different, no lunch was served DOH to CPH despite arriving afternoon 2pm. Champagne quality is lower and beers offer 3 options.  No cheese or olives offered HAN-BKK. Other sectors the cheese choice was only 3, compared to 5 on previous flights. Eating on demand is a good idea. Too many annoying PA's promoting Qatar as tourist destination, too many commercials/charity commercials made the IFE irritating. Business class was full or fairly full and the cabin attendants did a good job and were caring as usual.

No longer a separate building, but the lounge was huge. It must have been the size of ten tennis courts. The A380-800 on both trips and the A330-200 on the outbound trip was excellent.

They have lie flat seats, tons of leg room, storage in front of you, large overhead compartments, cheerful flight attendants, great service. The seat has a large TV monitor where you can watch all kinds of first run movies - over 50 choices. Games, music, plenty to entertain you if you don't want to sleep. It is a night flight, quiet and dark, so easy to sleep. The amenity kit is excellent. They serve a snack and 6 hours later breakfast. The food was ok, beverages the usual, including alcohol. The plane was fairly clean, pillows and blankets are comfortable. The seats have a small, flexible reading light. I don't remember if they have plugs for your phone/computer, but I think they do. All in all, it was very comfortable for a semi-long flight - it is only a little over 6 hours. The best part of being in Business class is when you get off in Bangkok, you get to go through priority immigration and visa! I sped right through.

Return to Doha from Athens on an A321, which had only angled seats but was more comfortable than A330. Being a 4-hour day flight also helped. Dinner was superb on this leg. Return to Melbourne was on time, and with comfortable lie flat Boeing 777 seats, I got a good nights rest. IFE in general was a bit hit and miss and the Boeing 777 screens were not the best.

I find Qatar Airways a quality consistent airline, this trip was no different, flights on time, in all directions. DWC to KTM via Doha, staff all pleasant this was a red eye, so sleep was the main requirement but unfortunetly with the aircraft used was not an option. A320 on a 4.5 hour night flight with non flat seats does not make for a comfortable sleep zone. So this was a negative. Crew onboard generally are polite, efficient but have a feeling of being robotic, they don't know how to be personable with passengers.

When the IFE malfunctioned before takeoff, I was tersely instructed not to touch the remote for 15 minutes, as if it were my fault. Thankfully, the excellent food and drink made up for the service. On arrival in Doha, everything improved. There was a separate waiting area to board the plane to Paris, my flight attendant was amazingly attentive and detail oriented - putting away my carry-on for me, explaining the menu and the seat, and asking me when I wanted to dine, and introducing herself to me by name. When I had my pre-landing meal, another flight attendant observed that I enjoyed my smoothie, and offered me another one, even though he wasn't my assigned flight attendant. That was the service I was expecting when I booked Qatar Airways. The seat and IFE on the A380 was better than any airline I've flown before.

2015-07-13,10.0,10.0,Brian McCaig,United Kingdom,Qatar Airways customer review,"A few years ago, I took advantage of a special offer from London with Qatar Airways in economy class, and was impressed with the standards of service then. Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,July 2015,Boeing 787,Edinburgh to Hong Kong via Doha,Edinburgh,Doha,Hong Kong,0.0,Yes
2015-07-13,8.0,10.0,R Gonzaga,Malaysia,Qatar Airways customer review,"Good flight on first leg. Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time.

Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week.

The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice.

Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time!

2015-07-06,8.0,10.0,Rob Bowden,United Kingdom,Qatar Airways customer review,"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only £925 each when it was over £1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there.

Al Mourjan Lounge offered an a la carte options as well as buffet. However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates.

I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see.

Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out.

2015-06-16,9.0,10.0,Ian Raymond,United Kingdom,Qatar Airways customer review,"First time traveller on Qatar Airways. We travelled in the business class cabin and as a frequent business class BA flyer I was amazed! It was much better than British Airways and cheaper! The seats are very comfortable with plenty of space and storage space. The TV was big and HD. The choice of films, TV, games and music is very good. The food choice and quality was really good. It was middle eastern based and included appetisers, starters, mains, deserts and a choice of breads. All in all we were so impressed. the stewardesses were attentive, polite and efficient. We will definitely be flying Qatar Airways again!",Couple Leisure,Business Class,June 2015,A388/A350/B788,London to Singapore via Doha,London,Doha,Singapore,0.0,Yes
2015-06-16,10.0,10.0,Anders Pedersen,Vietnam,Qatar Airways customer review,"Flew 5 June and back from CPH on 13 June routing HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH-DOH-BKK. HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR’s problem.

Not so good for the huge new Hamad International Airport. Meals were all delicious but could be improved in term of quantity. Entertainment onboard were nice, responsive and easy to navigate (It surely great for Indian pax, as it has a lot of Indian contents!). Inflight connectivity works. Cabin service were superb.

The aircraft was new, with a great entertainment system, big screen in each seat, many options of movies, series, tv shows, musics, etc. The seat had a good pitch and it was comfortable to sleep. The service aboard was relaxed and very good. Some attendants were serious and unfriendly and we had many interruptions with cabin calls and advertising, it stopped the movie I was watching many times.

This is difficult to comprehend at the huge new Hamad airport. Delayed departure from Abu Dhabi meant late arrival and fear of missing connection. Had to run miles with inaccurate information on airport departure boards indicating flight was boarding when in fact it was delayed. Seat pitch seemed tight. No hot towels or menu cards, although the menu was shown onscreen through the inflight entertainment system. Meal was tasty enough but small portion sizes. Good selection of drinks, with free champagne (in economy).",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,April 2015,A320 / A330,Abu Dhabi to Istanbul via Doha,Abu Dhabi,Doha,Istanbul,0.0,no

2015-06-13,9.0,10.0,B Wijesinghe,United States,Qatar Airways customer review,"IAD-DOH-CMB-DOH-IAD, Business Class in B777-300ER. Check-in excellent at IAD, followed-by the use of the Virgin Clubhouse. Virgin reception staff rather uptight, but the dining area staff was outstanding. All four flight segments were not full, so I had an empty seat next to me at all times. This is a huge benefit, as although the
seat has an outstanding pitch, is wide and very comfortable, it dates back to business class seating of a decade ago, with zero privacy between seats if you are travelling alone. A small bottle of water and a nice Georgio Amani amenity kit was awaiting my arrival, with a blanket, pillow and noise-cancelling headphones. Pyjamas and slippers were given out later on the segments to/from IAD. Staff service was very good on all segments and dine when you want service was good, though cutbacks are very evident in their menus. Of the four flight segments, QR 707 from DOH to IAD on 01 June had excellent crew serving the rear business class cabin where I was. Transit time was short at DOH, but the airport does not function logically, despite its showy architecture. Certainly no match for SIN and HKG. Check-in at CMB was efficient, and I used the UL Serendib Lounge due to my OW Emerald Tier status. Mid-week QR fare was very competitive, and provided very good value for money. Baggage delivery at IAD was much delayed, though probably not QR's fault. Will definitely use them again, especially as they are a OW member airline.",Business,Business Class,June 2015,B777-300ER,IAD-DOH-CMB-DOH-IAD,Dulles,Direct,Colombo,0.0,Yes
2015-06-13,6.0,10.0,J Scholfield,United Kingdom,Qatar Airways customer review,"Flew LHR to AUH via DOH return. Outbound on the 787,flight was full. Very claustrophobic, tiny seats, the service took forever. Flight left at 2130, it was nearly 3 hours later that I finally got a drink and something to eat. The meal was cold and when I pressed the call bell to try and get someone to heat my meal, I was ignored. Cannot believe on this evidence they are a 5 star airline. However coming back on QR5, it was like flying a completely different airline - friendly cabin crew, nice food, good service. Maybe it helped that the flight was half empty but what a difference. A330 a much nicer experience than the Dreamliner, wider seats, more legroom and just more comfortable.

In my opinion, this is the best business class product out there on the market. Everything was perfect on both flights: tasty food (excellent presentation), excellent champagne. The dine anytime service is much appreciated. The seat, especially on the B777, is comfy.
Very good amenity kit from Armani, the best noise cancelling headphones I have experienced on a plane. Entertainment system is good, even tho the choice of movies on the Milan-Doha segment was maybe too limited. What makes QR a 5-star airline is the cabin crew: extremely polite, friendly, smiling, very well groomed. As a Privilege club member, I was recognized by name on both sectors. Hamad International airport business lounge, huge but still crowded, is quite impressive. I do look forward to flying the A350 business product on my way back.",Business,Business Class,June 2015,A330-300 and B777-300,Milan-Doha and Doha-Guangzhou,Milan,Direct,Guangzhou,0.0,Yes

As others have commented, the B787 as fitted by QR is a major problem because of hard, narrow and just plain uncomfortable seats, which really is unacceptable for flights of seven to eight hours. This is such an issue as to overshadow other generally satisfactory aspects. I might fly QR again but not on their 787s.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,June 2015,B787,Singapore-Doha-Johannesburg,Singapore,Direct,Johannesburg,0.0,no
2015-06-13,6.0,10.0,Dan James,Australia,Qatar Airways customer review,"MEL-DOH-LHR-DOH-MEL, 777-300ER and A380. 4 flights and a mix of experiences. Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew. Cabin crew really should have stopped serving the two passengers hours before. The only major issue on an otherwise great trip.",Business,Business Class,June 2015,777-300ER and A380,MEL-DOH-LHR-DOH-MEL,Melbourne,Direct,London,0.0,no
