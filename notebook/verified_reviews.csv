Dishes are hot and tasty. Good beverages selection. Service: best customer service, personalized assistance. Seats configuration of economy class on Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner not the best but at least it’s not cramped like on big airlines of Europe or Asia. At the end of the day you get what you paid for, so if you want better food options, a seat like a sofa at your home or you need someone to put pillow under your head - choose business or first class accordingly.

The flight was good although food not especially from Doha to Amsterdam which was terrible (a smaller plane), then on the flight back to Australia on A380 the food was bad as well - the breakfast I chose was cream scrambled eggs - the first time food was cold so the air hostess brought another plate which was uncooked and not eaten, and coffee came out black and cold - orange juice warm and no ice.

The business class seat in the middle is very exposed on the 787, however the A350 was a much nicer cabin experience, even though the central overhead lockers are removed, the A350 seemed my more spacious and airy. Food was nothing exceptional, dine on demand is fine in business, however if your  to sleep and the passenger opposite decides at 2am to eat, you’ll be disturbed. The pyjamas were a lovely touch, but the rest of the bedding was really poor, think blankets and lumpy pillows. Service out of CPH was rushed and the crew seemed harangued, however on the MLE sector it was much improved,  the cabin was half full.

However on this flight to Paris - Bangkok - Doha and then Doha - Paris, I noticed a few things which should be improved. Check-in in Bangkok could be better and more classy. Business check-in was a bit too laid back. In Bangkok, Qatar uses Thai Airways Business lounge. It is a great lounge but some privileges are not accessible to Qatar business class passengers, massages for instance. Onboard, it was great however the selection of wines was better a few years ago.

I had 6 meals on this trip, sampled the first, picked at the second and third and just looked at the rest to see if there were any positive changes. Only one time did the attendant came by to pick up used cups, napkins. Since I had a window seat, I did not feel like squeezing past the aisle seat and walking my garbage down to the galley. They were good about handing out water - just not about collecting it.

Food was okay. I was looking forward to a cold beer but only 2 options of lager which is my last resort. The staff were all very attentive. Return flight Auckland to Doha had same pod set up which was again disappointing. The Doha to MAN leg actually had a newer plane, quieter and with individual pods - significantly better all round. I'm quite tech savvy but their in flight viewing control system remained a mystery to me, I managed to watch stuff but it wasn't particularly intuitive. On the last leg on the newer plane I had the problem of not being able to turn the headphone volume down enough, changing headphone set made no difference.

Checked in on line and choose seat a for both myself and my partner, bag drop at LHR T4 quick and polite security was very quick at 11am on a Thursday morning, was given access to the Skyteam lounge with my oneworld status? Qatar never offer there own lounge to FF but I guess it is advised in the rules. Anyway Skyteam lounge is pretty comfortable so fine. Boarded through gate A6 it was all very quick on to a newish clean A380 seats 31A & 31B on the upper deck.. Departed on time the flight wasn't full so a pretty nice atmosphere on board. Lunch served shortly after airborne was actually very nice lots of drinks offered during the flight with a hot sandwich tra coffee served about an hour before arrival. Had 3 hours in Doha which was a pleasant time visiting the shops onyx lounge and a walk around. Boarding the DOH-NRT flight from D22 via a bus however it wasn't too bad. The aircraft was spotless and strangely almost empty so while we had assigned seats we actually sat where we wanted with all but about 20 seats in the last cabin almost free. Departed on time again once airborne breakfast served quickly. I then slept across 4 seats for 6 hours once awake was offered coffee before I guess pre landing dinner which was okay but not as good as the previous flight. Landed on time after 9hrs 30min the whole trip was longer but much better than my usual BA. I have used QR about 20 times now in both business & economy.

Whilst my experience was perfectly adequate, I wasn't overwhelmed. The terminal they use at Manchester Airport couldn't be further from the train station, and Economy check-in was pretty average.

The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average, the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight, the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one.

Their staff informed me about that just 3.5 hours before original flight departure and that they are can't book me on other airlines flight. Even after I spoke with Duty Officer and explained I need to be at work tomorrow, they didn't help. My original tickets were for Business Class from Baku and First Class from Doha, but when I came to Airport for a flight booked for me, staff issued me Economy Class ticket for my flight from Doha. When I asked why, they said the QA system now shows Economy Class. It took me some time to prove that my original cancelled flight was for First class.

The seat layout is 2-2-2 instead of 1-2-1. The entertainment system proved slow/inconvenient and is not comparable to Qatar's own aircraft. The service was very slow and partially disorganized. This resulted e.g. in no drinks being served together with the meal. They have cut down on the menu choices compared to previous flights. Both the starter as well as the main course were tasteless.

Business class is really great especially on the Doha to New York Sector. Almost every few seats have a dedicated stewardess who pampers you all throughout the 12-13 hours. My biggest disappointment was they overbooked the flight from Doha to Chennai and upgraded several Economy passengers to Business. I have no worries with that and have been lucky myself several times. However, Qatar has to be sensitive to Business travellers who prefer to travel alongside other serious business travellers and not passengers who are noisy and get tipsy halfway through the flight.

Qatar Airways went beyond expectations when dealing with my luggage enroute to South Africa from Toronto with a transfer in Philly. Upon my arrival in Doha, I was called to the gate desk so they could ensure my luggage went on the plane with me. I've never experienced this before with any other airline. On my return overnight flight back from JoBurg, I accidentally left a package in the overhead bin. The manager at the transfer desk personally arranged for that package to be brought immediately from the plane, which was parked far away from the actual terminal building, to me so I could take it on my connecting flight to Chicago. My connection was tight but they made it happen... AND changed my seat allocation so I could have 3 seat empty seats for my transatlantic flight.

1273,2017-10-25,3.0,10.0,"""my itinerary had been changed""",B Carsen,United Kingdom,"✅ Verified Review |  Denpasar to London via Doha. I booked two round trips with Qatar Airways, one for Sept 25 to October 23rd and one for November 5th to Dec 17th. We are Gold Privilege members (only relevant for the lack of care shown for a frequent business class traveller). On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed. I had been bumped from the quick connection (1 hour 10m) in Doha onto a flight which left an hour and a half later. My arrival time at LHR would now be 10pm instead of 8.25pm; a real inconvenience for me. As it was Sunday afternoon in Bali, there was no office open to call and ask why the change. I tried the London and Doha offices; both were closed. The flight I had been bumped off was still being advertised online as being available to book, but I could do nothing, so I spent an hour making arrangements involving costly calls to the UK from Bali. I checked in early the next day and asked at the desk to put me back on the original flight. At first, the desk staff said they could not help me and I'd have to speak to the transfer desk in Doha, but once the question of which flight my bag would be checked to, came up (with me refusing to allow it to be on the later flight),  they were able to check me on to the earlier flight. I lost all my seat selections with a change of aircraft, and ended up on the undesirable window seats on both legs of the 777-300. The stewardess told me that the aircraft was changed 3 weeks before the flight; again, there was no notification about the change and that my allocated seats were no longer available. Neither of my two legs had internet on board. My arrival in Doha was delayed by half an hour so I had 40 minutes, along with 21 other passengers, to get to the next flight. We made it easily; however, I deeply regret getting onboard for the following: The mystery of being bumped was solved; much of the aircraft's business class section was occupied by a local family along with their appallingly behaved children of various ages. For 7 hours, non-stop, we were bombarded by toddlers running around or screaming to each other across rows of seats, by their staff running in and out of economy trying to control the children, by people swapping seats constantly and by members of the family bringing more toddlers and babies from other cabins to socialise. This wasn't a business class experience; it was being in a creche for a day. The cabin crew were beside themselves with trying to control the situation.

Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on  A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present. Outstanding flight crews on all four flights, friendly and attentive to your needs a credit to Qatar Airways. Due to short transit time didn't have time to visit the business class lounge at Hamad International Airport although I did manage a short time there on my flight home. Similar experience at Bangkok, early check-in for flights and fast track through passport control the new Qatar lounge isn't open yet so still using one or other of two Thai Airways lounge noticed they've removed the TV screen since me previous visit which only ever had CNN.

I chose a flight with a longer transit in between, so I could see Doha with a complimentary tour of Doha. I landed just in time to make it to their evening tour, which is the last tour of the day. I had about 45 min before the tour starts, so as soon as I landed, I quickly made my way to the immigration, and headed out. When I was out, I was looking for the location of the desk, where it says it’s at concourse B. I managed to find WH Smith, but there was no desk close by. I went to the information desk and asked where to find this tour, the lady told me it’s before immigration. I know I was running out of time, it wouldn’t make sense for me to go back to the other side and come back out again. Therefore I asked the lady if she could call the tour desk for me, to let them know I was waiting outside. The lady was not helpful at all, she was unwilling to call for me. I asked her what option do I have if I want to join the tour, she said I have to go back in to join the tour. So I followed her advice and went back in. Before I went back in, I spoke to 2 other staff, I told them the reason I was out, and the reason I had to go back inside, they just said ‘ok’ and pointed towards the security and immigration to me. I wanted to make sure I can actually go back inside and come back out again afterwards. Since 2 people I’ve asked said ok, I thought it would be ok. By the time I got back in, I finally found his desk for the tour. There was a closed sign at the desk, but I went to speak to the lady there, she told me I was too late, they cannot add me to the tour group any more.  She told me to come back the next day. My connecting flight was early morning, I would be gone by then!  I saw an information desk about Doha, so I went over, and asked for some information if I wanted to go out myself (the only helpful and friendly guy I’ve spoken to during my time at the Doha Airport!) I’ve got all the information I need, including a map, so I was ready to go through immigration to head out again on my own this time.

Originally booked this flight for the Boeing 787 operating it but about 4 weeks before departure noticed that it was now an A330, no problem as I like the A330. Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented.

Eventually, at check-in, I upgraded to business class for miles (“Q-credits”). This was easy, and I had only to wait 5 Minutes until the flight manager could confirm that the appropriate food could be availed within this short notice of only 2½ hours. It worked out and I signed a form to deduct Q-credits from my FFP programme. In Copenhagen QR uses Aspire, a third party lounge, one of the poorest lounges – no hot food, poor drinks etc. Boarding was easy and quick. At seat, pre-departure soft drinks were drink provided. No pre-departure champagne offered – only for CPH and CDG in Europe champagne is not served pre-departure? Food was so, so and tasteless. Drinks and wine list were excellent, served upon take off with hot nuts and hot towels. New onboard is an Italian beer Peroni, which is quite good and tasty. Guinness, Stella Artois, and Corona have gone. The safety video has improved. The annoying charity collections on Educate a Child goes on, I am puzzled by this.

Well done. The bartenders did not have their best day, but the visitors made up for it. I don’t like that some visitors paid tips to lounge staff.

This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware.

This time I was lucky to get both legs on the A330-300 so I could avoid the Boeing 777-300 and cramped B787. The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles. My suggestion would be to choose the aircraft wisely if you have the option to do that.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Berlin via Doha,July 2017,no,A330-300,

Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking.

I am a Platinum Privilege Club member with well over 2000 Points - which means I fly on Qatar a lot, usually at least 20-30 sectors a year, sometimes more. I had only flown on Economy once before as the other time I had an economy seat they upgraded me. All in all, not bad for a short hop. I was, however, irked just after take off when I asked for a beer and was refused, on the apparent basis that they did not serve alcohol on local Middle East flights. I know that upfront I would have been sipping Champagne by then. Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have  10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up.

The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly.  On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries.

Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi.

My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland. It seems that the service on routes like to/from Khartoum leaves a lot to be desired as does the fact that they still use remote stands and the food in general was a let down.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Khartoum via Doha,May 2017,,A350 / A321 / A380,

When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well.

I don't know what the purpose of OneWorld now is. It promises smooth travels with its partner Airlines. What for is the frequent flyer status when one is placed in situations such as this.

Very comfortable flight all around and was able to use my cpap machine for sleep apnoea in flight with no issues which was why I chose the Qatar option in first place (787s all the way). Only criticism would be the IFE touch screen was very sluggish and the children's meals were drab plus no play packs for kids. On arrival at Doha had long walk carrying kids. Then found the Boeing 787 to Cape Town changed at last minute to Boeing 777-300. There was an air of frantic rush here as we were herded on plane when we should have departed. The seats were so unfortunately and no power for my medical equipment. Unlike previous flight staff did not know of my medical request and so I had a horrendous flight with no sleep.

Economic reality dictates these days that my QR flying has now to be in Economy, not Biz.  Both BCN sectors were in A330, which, though a little dated are a perfectly acceptable plane for a 6 hr flight. Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat. These people need to get the message that they cannot go squeezing yet more seats into already overcrowded jets to make a fast buck.

Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered. Overall, very impressed with the service that Qatar offers, and would certainly consider using them again flying to Asian destinations if the price is competitive with (e.g.) Singapore Airlines.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bali via Doha,August 2016,,A330 / Boeing 787,

The flights from Doha to Bangkok had particularly bad food, no middle eastern food was offered which I found strange. My chicken and potatoes with vegetables reminded me of a discount meal.

The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed.

Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent.

They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the  red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class.

FAs on the last sector (to CPH) were much less professional and uncertain on how to please passengers as compared to FAs on the BKK-DOH sector. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha is very good. Very cheap ticket purchased during their ”global sale” in May 2016, almost a year earlier. Miles were very generous due to unexpected, additional promotions (that I randomly ran in to as they were not there when ticket was purchased) and instantly credited to my account. My Priv. Club card was instantly upgraded to Platinum even before landing in Copenhagen. This I would call for a pleasant and soft landing. IFE good, amenity kit replaced by new brand, lovely.

(Ch. Brane Cantanac red, fine Chablis and Babich Sauvignon from Marlborough NZ). Best of all was the flexibility about when to eat and being such a long flight, there was a constant supply of bottled water, cups of tea and snacks. The seating arrangement works well with easy access to the aisles although a little more storage space for the things we want beside us on a long haul flight would have been more helpful.

So much so they were still checking in the early flight to Doha. QR 150 not 152. But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s.

Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware?  Plenty of individual entertainment options; a nice seat pack that included eyeshades, ear plugs,and other goodies; good blanket; good earphones, etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies - and maybe as a result (or else we had exceptional parents, babies and children both ways), little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long, exhausting flights). I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again, and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class, but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing: Next time, I intend to make a stopover in Doha, especially on the way back, because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return, maybe due to time differences, we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover, because from the airport, on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours.

From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner.  The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally.

Flight from Doha to Singapore delayed by almost 3 hours as we arrived in Doha. I had to ask the transfer counter as my onward journey from Singapore will be affected. One agent at the transfer counter listened to me and calmly suggested another flight to my final destination. She changed my second flight and I finally got to my final destination yesterday, although 2 hours later. I would like to thank her for listening calmly and then to offer a different flight. She is a true gem indeed and this reflects well on Qatar Airways. Unlike other transfer staff who didn't listen and just gave us a meal voucher without explaining or listening to the customers. Thanks to her professionalism, this review is getting a decent rating although my second flight was delayed.

We and the rest of the passengers put on all winter clothing we had and asked the cabin crew to make it warmer at least a little bit. It took five hours of asking to make it warmer in the cabin. I think the cabin crew just did not understand what we were talking about as the galley areas were warmer. They give you a brunch menu but our choice was finished by the time they get to us.

However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes). I have sent two emails via the Qatar frequent flyer webpage which have been ignored. Customer service in Australia appears to be non existent!

That is a huge downfall as in this case I will have to check in my luggage again in Bangkok – this, despite that my next carrier is their Oneworld alliance member, Malaysia Airlines. That cost me an hour and a half extra struggle in BKK due to cease of this baggage further transfer service – this is an unacceptable change and huge deterioration of service - likely inspired by BA who recently stopped offering further luggage transfers. All flights on time. Poor lounge offered in CPH, a third party lounge called Aspire – likely the most boring lounge in the world. Pre-departure drinks in CPH offered but with soft drinks only. When QR departs from any other Scandinavian Airport like OSL, HEL, or ARN they offer full drink service predeparture – why can’t they do it in CPH? Menu had no seafood, fish, or lamb. Icecream offered but they ran out of stock before they reached my seat 4A, despite having initially ordered. No smoothies. Cheeseplate available. Good wines and spirits. 3 beers offered, provide no alternative as they are almost identical and dull in taste (Corona, Heineken, and Foster). FAs did a great job. Lounge in Doha excellent.

Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top.

Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious.

Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed.

Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived.

I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive,  the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge.

Little to be said about connecting flights to / from Abu Dhabi. The Doha to Perth leg was on a Boeing 777-300 in 3x4x3 configuration, the return an aircraft with the old 3x3x3 seating. It would be wrong to suggest the revised seating is terrible. Leg room was ample, certainly far more generous than the equivalent provided by Etihad for example, and the food and IFE were to the usual high standard. Nonetheless, yet more dumbing down of standards / cutting costs to the point where there is increasingly little to differentiate its economy service from other operators. I lost count of the number of times I was bumped by passing traffic on the flight to Perth.

We flew out on the 777-300ER (when we booked it was supposed to be the 787 but was later changed to this), where the seats were comfortable (reasonable leg room for Economy class), food was to a high standard and the IFE had a huge selection of movies/TV shows to select from. The staff were courteous at all times as well. From Doha to Islamabad it was the A320 which despite being a smaller aircraft had the similar feel to the 777. The IFE was of the same quality, food (although only served once) too was of the similar high standard.

I managed to get the fare for about $3500 which was far cheaper than any of the other options I had leaving ATL and was impressed with the overall experience. There are a couple of very minor things that might have bothered me if I hadn't got such a good deal. The 2x2x2 configuration seems dated nowadays and the service although great was a little annoying as the attendant who serviced my seat kept trying to suggest things rather that waiting for me to make a decision, but really these are minor comments. Given its a 13 hour flight the I was suitably fed, watered and entertained to have keep me happy. Was there anything absolutely outstanding and noteworthy? No, but there also wasn't anything to significantly complain about. Despite my earlier comment about the configuration, the seats were way better than Delta's business one lay flat and although I gave a good review about AF's long haul BC this was better, even though I can't put my finger on why. I am however looking to my return to USA. The first class lounge at Doha is something to behold. More like a ultra discreet luxe hotel restaurant than a lounge and well worth spending a short time in. The short 45 minute flight to KWI was uneventful, but managed to get a meal in overall great service for a short flight.

Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none. Very badly designed seat/window for the wall paneling of the seat by your head is too high and covers the window buttons.

The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard.

Three of my flights were on the A350 which is the best of the new aircraft, quite spacious in economy - lots of legroom but the width was a bit cramped, despite being wider than the 787. The Boeing 777 was 10-across and horrible, especially in the middle two seats. At least it was only two hours, but it shows that aircraft selection has a big impact on economy comfort. Apart from the 777, which was unfortunately packed, the other flights were quite empty, increasing the comfort levels and meaning that they offered quite reasonable upgrades on every one of my legs.

Qatar uses a multi-airline lounge at HAN which offers mediocre food and spirits but spectacular views of the runway and tarmac. There were very few passengers on the HAN-BKK segment, so boarding did not have to be ""organized"" in any fashion. Despite a very quick turnaround, the plane was clean, neat, and well-prepared. The welcome drink included a choice of two different champagnes. I chose the Billecart-Salon, which was excellent. The snack service was quick and tasty, accompanied by another glass of champagne. The seat back TV screens are huge, with a clear and sharp picture. I entertained myself with the sky-map, but if the flight had been longer, there was a huge selection of movies, TV shows, and music.

First Class DOH-CAI-DOH is de facto just only business class but in widebody. On the outbound they served only breakfast and no meat-dishes were offered. Likewise no fresh garlic, ginger, chilli nor fish-sauce is available. No ice-cream, mango smoothies (only strawberry). But the extensive drink list and the cabin staff service made it somehow up. On Cairo to Doha it was a more fully fledged menu with excellent options. From Cairo pre-departure champagne was not offered due to local laws. Cost cutting edges has also begun to show in Doha, where they stopped a la carte servings in Al Mourjan lounge. However, in the alternative Al Safwa first class lounge they provide even fully fledged free “hotel rooms” inside the lounge.

I agreed to the payment. A few days later our credit card bill showed a huge deduction. It has taken me 2 months of emails to get 2 replies from Qatar Airways. The replies make little sense.

I asked the cabin crew to raise the temperature and was answered that the captain would have to decide on that. IFE systems was loaded with advertisement.

The inflight experience is what I am paying for in deciding to fly business. The initial minor problems in the Sydney to Doha leg seemed to arise from our seats being in the last row in the business class section. On boarding the flight to Doha we were asked if we would like pyjamas. On replying yes, we were told only XXL was left, which were so big we could not use them. We were then asked to choose dinner. I asked for dinner to be served as soon as the plane had reached its cruising altitude. When dinner was served, approximately 30 minutes after take off, I was told my choice of wine had run out. So, of the 3 white wines available (not a great selection in the first place) the one I had chosen had run out within 30 minutes of take off. Similarly, when dessert was served we were told the one dessert wine available which we had asked for had also run out. The crew member told us only 2 half bottles had been available for the whole of the business class cabin. We complained to the cabin supervisor who apologised and said they had in fact found some dessert wine and brought us a glass. It all just seemed a little poorly organised and executed. These are small points, but this is exactly why I am willing to pay double the cost of an economy ticket for a business class service. It is the small details that make the difference. Without them, I might as well be in economy. The main problem was my seat would not fully extend to flat. The foot rest remained vertical, so it was not possible to lie down. Staff attempted to physically fix it but were unable to do so. The seat had jammed halfway between upright and flat. 3 staff spent approximately 30 minutes under the seat trying to fix it. This was about halfway through the flight, during which time we both had to stand in the aisle while they tried to fix it. The flight was full, so there was nowhere else we could go. So neither of us were able to sleep fully during the flight. On asking how we would be able to land with the seat stuck in this position, the crew suggested I might have to sit in a crew jump seat as there were no other seats available. In the end, they physically pushed the seat back into a semi-upright position that they said was sufficient for landing purposes. But no sleep for me or my partner. The cabin supervisor suggested I write in to complain. More than 6 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response to my initial email.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,SYD to ATH via DOH,July 2016,no,,

The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags.

Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs.

Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however.

Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in’s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class.  Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice.  I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I’d prefer chairs to sofas – and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, “Aspire”, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN. The biggest faults are the never-ending bus-rides in Doha (at least one bus trip per stopover for me in Doha. Ramadan caused that lounges in Doha were alcohol dry.

Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal.

In short, this was a memorable experience and the service we received in business class was outstanding. Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits. The senior flight attendant was helpful setting up my phone for the on-board wi-fi. Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife. On arrival in NY, each one came to say goodbye to the passengers which I thought was very graceful. The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats were not as new as the A350 but nevertheless were comfortable and managed to get good few hours of sleep ahead of the day out in Doha. There was no wi-fi on this aircraft. The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant. The food didn’t taste as exceptional as on board. However, there was a good selection in the menu as well as in the buffet.

The crew was extremely attentive hat off to the cabin services supervisor and her staff. The Food was superb and the in flight entertainment very good for short haul. The Qatar business lounge at Hamad airport was dry (no alcohol) because it was Ramadan.

This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat.

When I tried to retrieve my 3 bins at the other end of the conveyor belt, they were not contiguous, and the first was widely separated from the last, with other people's bins in between (I remember seeing other people's dirty laundry, family pictures, a jewelry box, and wad of cash). It was not trivial to re-pack the 3 bin contents into the bags - at the hotel it had taken me half an hour, but I managed to do it in 10 minutes, still too long for the impatient security staff.

Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class.

Other passengers were not happy to the point that 2 coppers arrived and led a passenger away (just a quiet word did the trick). In the end it was nearly 3 hours late taking off although at least 1 passenger decided not to fly which I think added to the delay as they had to offload her bags. Once in the air, I was pleased I had chosen Qatar Airways as without doubt their economy seat is the most comfortable I have ever travelled in. I think some airlines have the 777-EW as 3-5-3 where as Qatar have gone with 3-4-3 so are less narrow plus these seats also have good lumbar support. Less impressive were the food offerings, I had opted for a vegetarian dish which was very spicy but the FA on seeing that I had not really touched my main, was quick to offer an alternative. I hadn't actually said a word of complaint which amazed me as my usual experience with FAs when travelling economy is that they barely register you exist. On arriving in Doha at around 4am, I was pleasantly surprised how efficient Qatar's ground staff were as they had already booked me a hotel room and issued a new boarding pass. Had to go through immigration which was painless then off to Movenpick Towers and Suites with a 250 Rials credit (about £50) to be used for food. I also had my suitcase sent to the hotel which arrived within 2 hours. This was enough for 2 good meals using room service but was told I could not use the restaurant. (Qatar passengers are banned from using the restaurant on Fridays). Also slightly annoying was that the hotel gave the 250 credit in 3 vouchers (100+75+75) so if I wanted to place a food order for 110, I was told I would have to use 2x75 and not receive a voucher for unused 40 Rials. Anyhow bus picked me up at midnight, took me back to airport and checked in for my Hanoi flight. Think it was a different aircraft as economy was 3x3x3 but seats looked identical and just as comfortable. Flight seemed to go quickly including around 60 minutes stop in BKK. Food offerings were even worse than the Manchester-Doha leg but wasn't too bothered as wasn't really hungry anyhow. Hanoi arrival was very smooth into what looks like a brand new terminal.

The crew took my order for lunch and drinks prior to take off. They asked when I wanted it - I said probably later as we had just had breakfast at the airport. They asked me to give them a 15 minute notice on when I wanted the food. Champagne and nuts served after take off. Lunch was soup, followed by an arabic meze. Main course was a spicy chicken dish and finally some ice cream. I declined the cheese course. Great choice of wines, Seating extremely comfortable and versatile. I managed some good quality sleep in the recline mode. The better cabin air atmosphere on the 787 was noticeable. Good selection of inflight entertainment although it took a little while to get used to the remote handset. Interactive flight display but no tail or belly cam. I used the wifi which was seemed to be free for only 15 minutes - easy to log on - and I managed to zap out a couple of emails. On time arrival. The crew allowed all the business class passengers to leave the plane first.

I rang them to ask what has happened and they say the Doha-Auckland flight has been cancelled so I will have to travel to Sydney and pay for the Sydney-Auckland flight. On online forums I can see they have offered free replacement flights to other customers but are now refusing to do this any more. This is against EU aviation law EC261 which states Qatar are liable for rerouting costs when they choose to cancel flights. It also goes against what it states in their own terms and conditions.  They are telling me I will have to pay £2000+ to book alternative flights.

In May 2016, we found out that the flights were canceled, allegedly because the route was cancelled due to delivery difficulties of the A350, and thus the Boeing 777-200LR is used on other routes. The German/Polish Qatar Airways Call Center offered generous manner, either to refund our ticket, or to move the trip to February, which is not possible, however, because the lodges are already booked for the tour in New Zealand, and not may be canceled. A flight to Sydney and then a connecting flight to Auckland was declined by Qatar Airways, because obviously the One World partner Qantas no longer operates since 17/05/2016 with Qatar together.

Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there.

I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past, but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This, in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays! The service takes a long time in coming and when it does, they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and don't come back to ask if you'd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay, the pastry, terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk, himself.

Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she’d phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there.

Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight.

We accepted very reluctantly to fly to Birmingham, as this was extremely inconvenient, only to be told that the airline would not organise or pay for onward travel from Birmingham to Brussels. We also faced a wait of 7 hours at Doha airport instead of the previously scheduled 2 hours. We asked if there was a possibility of an upgrade or a place in the Business lounge but we were told that it was not company policy. At Doha airport, we tried to book train tickets from Birmingham to London and from London to Brussels on the Eurostar but there were no printing facilities we could find. It was also cold and extremely noisy, with the children's play area right next to the quiet room .Our train tickets cost us £33 each and Eurostar tickets 382 euros, out of our own pocket. We finally arrived at Birmingham airport to discover there were no trains that day to London, due to overhead cables being down. We finally arrived in Brussels at 11.30pm, having been due to arrive originally at 7.25am. An email of complaint to Qatar Airways was met with the inflexibility we had encountered from the supervisor at Cape Town airport. This was the first time we had travelled with this airline and it will be the last.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,CPT to BHX via BRU,April 2016,no,Boeing 787,
1659,2016-04-06,3.0,10.0,"""bad experience with a big family""",Uwe Guenther,Switzerland,"✅ Verified Review |  A bad experience with a big family on the flight from Cape Town to Doha that basically took over the business section, messed up the bathrooms and used the space in front of the toilets for praying - so much so, that one felt guilty to get up to use the lavatory. This family also had a child, that was screaming for nine hours. The child is not to blame - the parents did not pack single toy or drawing book etc.  Original ticket had a layover in Doha of more than 8 hours that with complimentary hotel. Qatar changed the times which resulted in the cancellation of this hotel booking. I was assured by there are ample sleeping opportunities in the Business lounge in Doha but do not bet on this. Lounge was cold and too noisy for sleeping. Quiet zone was occupied  so you are waiting there for your next flight until the next morning. Next shorter flight in bad business seat in A320 and I could not sleep properly. Will not book again if they have a layover of less than 8 hours.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,CPT to BEG via DOH,April 2016,no,Boeing 787 / A320,

The Boeing 777 had the best legroom but narrow seats, A340 was very cramped, the Boeing 787 average but narrow seat. Onboard service by crew was good. I found the food inedible and was very disappointed. All flights on time though so that was a bonus. Not sure how you get five star service in economy.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to CNB via DOH,March 2016,no,Boeing 777 / 787 / A340,

Everything about the experience was excellent both on the ground and in the air. Great food and drink, comfortable seats, wide range of entertainment and punctual flights. The dedicated Qatar Airways arrivals lounge for premium passengers at Doha was new (to me) and worked very well.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,EDI to MLE via DOH,March 2016,,Boeing 787 / A330 / A320,

The crew were well turned out, the service was very polite, friendly and smiling. The meals were way above average. Legroom was more than adequate (maybe I'm just short) and the inflight entertainment was not lacking. I loved my experience with them and I would definately fly them again.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to CPT via DOH,February 2016,,,
1665,2016-03-26,10.0,10.0,"""fantastic business class experience""",A Ahmed,United Kingdom,"✅ Verified Review |  Copenhagen to Melbourne visa Doha return. This was a fantastic business class experience and I understand now the recognition QR get for their product. From ground to air, they are streets ahead of most airlines. The 1-2-1 seating on the Boeing 787 is amazing, comfortable and provides an intimate and private space on a long flight - even the 2-2-2 seating on the Boeing 777 was a very respectable product. The catering is fantastic, on all flights the quality was high and beautifully presented. The Barramundi in Saffron sauce I was served on the way back from Melbourne, was something I would be very happy with at a high end restaurant! There biggest asset is their staff who provide consistent and warm hospitality. I was greeted by name on boarding on several flights, including with 'salaam' which was a nice touch. The lounge staff were friendly without being overbearing and the guy manning the showers outbound deserves a massive pat on the back as he went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed to get refreshed. Outbound on my flight DOH-MEL I was unwell so unfortunately didn't get to enjoy the catering (which looked amazing from the menu) or bar but was well looked after by staff onboard the flight including the CSD who checked up on me throughout the flight. Inbound on the last leg to CPH, my seat area hadn't been cleaned properly due to late landing and turnaround of the plane. This was unacceptable but once crew was informed she was embarrassed and tried her best to rectify the problem and tried to more make up for it through the rest of the flight.  All in all the soft service is really what sets QR apart from their rivals.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,CPH to MEL via DOH,February 2016,,Boeing 787-8 / 777-300ER,
1666,2016-03-24,1.0,10.0,"""no staff were waiting""",Alan Hepburn,China,"✅ Verified Review |  A recent trip from Dubai to Edinburgh via Doha was wrecked. Dubai to Doha flight delayed due to weather which is fair enough, cabin crew and supervisor reassured us that the Captain had called and we'd land 20 mins before departure so would be whisked to our flight to Edinburgh - however no staff were waiting, and the connections desk told us the gate was closed. Some hours later (after being re-routed via London) our London flight was delayed for over an hour to await connecting passengers, so we were likely to miss the London to Edinburgh connection arranged on British Airways - no ground staff waiting on arrival for us there despite promises. The British Airways flight was delayed due to technical fault so we arrived 12 hours late with no luggage  - missed my wife's surprise party and champagne breakfast the next morning as I had to get up early to go and collect luggage from the airport.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,DXB to LHR via DOH,March 2016,no,,
